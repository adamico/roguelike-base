** TODO Comments about Object role + what it uses other objects for

** DONE Move UI/Render Responsibility outside of Game - reverse dependency
- UI Object? GamePlay Scene object?

** DONE What to do with the game data? Component + Prototype Definitions?
- Maybe just keep them fixed inside the world? No need to inject that? Since World simulation depends on those
  components anyways?


** TODO Event Store
*** TODO Separate Event Store from World
- Storing the events long term, world can still keep track of last tick events

*** TODO Event Store: Cache Events in File ?


** TODO Things to carry over from 7DRL2023
*** TODO Map Renderer + FOV basic implementation
*** TODO ProcGen Phase Framework + Visualizer + Parameter setter + Seed Browser
