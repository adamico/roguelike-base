** TODO Comments about Object role + what it uses other objects for

** TODO Move UI/Render Responsibility outside of Game - reverse dependency

  components anyways?

- Storing the events long term, world can still keep track of last tick events

*** TODO Event Store: Cache Events in File ?


** TODO Things to carry over from 7DRL2023
